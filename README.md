Eveandrh = Eve + Rest Hooks

[Rest hooks](http://resthooks.org/) allow your Eve app to notify other services/clients of operations on your Eve API
app via REST. Follow the link to find out more information. In the rest hooks authors' own words:

>REST Hooks itself is not a specification, it is a collection of patterns that treat webhooks like subscriptions. 
These subscriptions are manipulated via a REST API just like any other resource.
